# Reanalysis-Cross-et-al-2012-using-event-history-analysis
We use discrete-time event history analysis to reanalyze the behavioral data (response time and accuracy) reported by 
Emily S. Cross, Nichola Rice Cohen, Antonia F. de C. Hamilton, Richard Ramsey, George Wolford, Scott T. Grafton (2012).
Physical experience leads to enhanced object perception in parietal cortex: Insights from knot tying.

# Preregistration on OSF using simulated data
We preregistered our intended reanalysis using a Bayesian event history analysis on the OSF. The following two files are relevant:

* sim_descriptives.Rmd

In sim_descriptives.Rmd we generate a fake data set with the same structure as the one reported by Cross et al. (2012) and calculate the descriptive statistics for a discrete-time event history analysis, as part of our (pre)registration on the OSF.

* sim_inferential.Rmd

In sim_inferential.Rmd we fit Bayesian hazard models to a simulated data set, and calculate the effects of interest, as part of our (pre)registration on the OSF.
